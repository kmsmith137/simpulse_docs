## simpulse_docs

If you are viewing this online, you probably want the link
[https://kmsmith137.github.io/simpulse_docs/](https://kmsmith137.github.io/simpulse_docs/)
instead, for web-browseable documentation.

**Note that the documentation is for the cmake_pybind11 branch of simpulse, not the master branch!**
The cmake_pybind11 simpulse branch will be merged to master soon.

This git repository ("simpulse_docs") contains source code for the simpulse **documentation**.
The source code for simpulse itself is its own git repository
[https://github.com/kmsmith137/simpulse](https://github.com/kmsmith137/simpulse).
We use two git repositories to avoid bloating the "code" repository with image files, fonts, etc.
You only need to clone the "documentation" repository if you want to update the online documentation,
or build your own local copy of the documentation.
