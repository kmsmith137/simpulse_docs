## simpulse_docs

The simpulse_docs repository contains documentation for [simpulse](https://github.com/kmsmith137/simpulse),
and is web-browseable via this link: [https://kmsmith137.github.io/simpulse_docs/](https://kmsmith137.github.io/simpulse_docs/).

The simpulse docs and code are in separate git repositories, in order to avoid bloating the "code" repository
with image files, fonts, etc.  You only need to clone the "docs" repository if you want to update the online documentation,
or build your own local copy of the documentation.

Note that the master branch of simpulse is not documented here!
This is the `cmake_pybind11` branch, which will be merged to master soon.
(At this point, the simpulse_docs repo and the simpulse repo can also be combined.)
